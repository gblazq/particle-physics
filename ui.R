Superimposed on the histogram, a simulated density function is shown. The density function is calculated according to a model with two contributions: an unknown fraction of the candidates are real disintegrations and the rest are noise.
The real disintegrations are known to follow a normal distribution with &sigma; = 100 MeV/c<sup>2</sup> centered at the mass of the B<sup>0</sup> meson, and the noise is modelled by an exponential distribution with finite support and rate = 1/1000."),

With a fraction of valid observations equal to 1, the model is a gaussian distribution; while a fraction equal to 0 corresponds to a pure noisy model."),
