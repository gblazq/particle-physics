# Find the 

This is a project for the Developing Data Products course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

It consists of a Shiny app where the user can select two parameters in order to visually minimize
the chi-squared error of a model and statistically determine the rest mass of the B0 meson.

More information about the model [here](http://gblazq.github.io/particle-physics/index.html).

The Shiny app can be accessed [here](https://gblazq.shinyapps.io/particle-physics/).
